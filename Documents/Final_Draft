#2: AN OVERVIEW OF PROJECT/PROJECT IDEA
    • We will be taking an existing source code of the Snake game and altering some features.
    • Some features to be altered:
        ◦ Color of the Snake itself
        ◦ Snake changes color every time it eats a new food.
        ◦ Shape of the snake.
        ◦ Snake changes shape every time it eats new food.
        ◦ We will make the food the snake eats bounce around instead of staying in one location
        ◦ The food changes colors every time it bounces of a wall of the canvas.
    • We want to make this add a variety of features to make this Snake game less simple and different unique visual effects.

#3: GOALS OF YOUR SOFTWARE
    • We want to take existing source code and alter it.
    • Apon altering the existing code, we want to make sure it runs properly with the modification we make.
    • We will be able to make our modifications noticeable.
    • We want to make the game visually appealing to the user.

#4: RESOURCES USED TO BUILD YOUR SOFTWAR
    • Github link of repository:
    • We use Github to keep track up updates we do to any of the source code.
    • We will use an existing open source code.

#5: MENTION HOW YOU WOULD USE THESE RESOURCES IN YOUR PROJECT
    • We would download the github repository and then change the code to our project idea/goal
    • We be able to use github to commit code with comments to help better understand changes being made.
    • The existing source code will guide us to makes new modifications.

#6 NEW FEATURES TO EXISTING PROJECT
